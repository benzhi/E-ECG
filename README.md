# E-ECG
Method for obtaining reliably measured normal-to-normal RR intervals in exercise ECGs, quality control measurements and plots.

##Further documentation will be added at a later time

### Basic example
run using `Rscript E-ECG.main.R example/example_participants.qrs.csv` to create 1) a file containing heart rate variables in rest, exercise and recovery, 2) a plot (.pdf) that shows the RR-interval in time for inspection:



![RR](example.jpg "example RR interval profile")


pr = rest phase (before exercise starts), ex= exercise phase , re = recovery phase.
